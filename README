0.2 Summary
===========

Dir::Project provides a way to locate a source-controlled checkout
directory (CVS, Subversion, Perforce, etc) using only the current
working directory (cd).  This prevents users from having to set other
environment variables when they switch between areas.

   Project_bin allows a single symlink to a user script to be placed in
a global PATH.  Project_bin then automatically finds that script inside
the source controlled area.  Different users, or different checkouts
will execute the script in their areas.  Thus, problems with version
mismatch across executing tools are eliminated.

     # One-time setup
     ln -s project_bin /global/dir/my_tool
     PATH = "/global/dir"
     DIRPROJECT_PATH = "bin_under_project"

     # Usage
     cd project1
     project_dir --project
          /path/to/project1
     my_tool my_args....   # Executes project1/.../my_tool

     cd project2
     project_dir --project
          /path/to/project2
     my_tool my_args....   # Executes project2/.../my_tool

   You can also determine the project directory from a makefile:

     include $(DIRPROJECT_PREFIX)/lib/project_dir.mk
     # Now use $(DIRPROJECT)

0.3 Obtaining Distribution
==========================

Log-Detect is part of the L<http://www.veripool.com/> free EDA software
tool suite.  The latest version is available from
`http://www.perl.org/CPAN/', and from `http://www.veripool.com/'.

   Download the latest package from that site, and decompress.  `gunzip
Log-Detect_version.tar.gz ; tar xvf Log-Detect_version.tar'

0.4 Supported Systems
=====================

This version of Dir::Project has been built and tested on:

   * i386-linux

   It should run on any system with Perl5.

0.5 Installation
================

  1. `cd' to the directory containing this README notice.

  2. Type `perl Makefile.PL' to configure Dir::Project for your system.
     (Note this package will probably run slower if you are still using
     perl 5.005.)

  3. Type `make' to compile Dir::Project.  Some non-GNU makes may give
     errors about DIST_DEFAULT, if so you can simply remove that line
     from Makefile.PL, and repeat the last two steps.

  4. Type `make test' to check the compilation.

  5. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  6. See `man project_bin' and `man Dir::Project' for usage information.
